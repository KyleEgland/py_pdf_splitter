# py_pdf_splitter

Splitting an input PDF into an output PDF with Python 3.

## Synopsis

This project is under construction and still in need of much re-factoring. This project is intended to be an "evergreen" learning project that serves as an example (starting point for future projects) as well as a demonstration of my own learning and understanding - or, at least, an ability to search the net and copy of others (script kiddy ftw!).

## Introduction

This project came from the article [Building a PDF Splitter Application](https://pbpython.com/pdf-splitter-gui.html) which provided the initial code for splitting a PDF with Python 3. The GUI used in the example on the aforementioned website, however, uses appjar whereas this code uses tkinter.

### Dependencies

- TKinter (built-in)
- PyPDF2 (pip install PyPDF2)
